## 1. Initial Detection & acknowledgement

> Before any incident can be formally reported, it must first be detected and acknowledged. Detection vectors can vary, ranging from human observation to automated alerts generated by deployed security tools. In some cases, the threat actor themselves may trigger the detection, especially if you're dealing with a ransomware incident.

## 2. Preliminary Analysis

> During this phase, the scope and potential ramifications of the security incident must be ascertained. The incident should be categorized based on our previously established classification and severity metrics.

## 3. Incident Logging

> Every facet, action, and observation related to the security incident should be meticulously logged using an established system. Popular platforms for this purpose include [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [TheHive Project](https://thehive-project.org/). In the absence of such a system, alternative methods should be employed. Even rudimentary tools like pen and paper or a spreadsheet can suffice in a pinch.

## 4. Notification of Relevant Parties

- `Internal Communications`
    - Relevant internal departments, such as IT, legal, PR, and executive teams, should be alerted. In cases where the incident has widespread and severe implications, an organization-wide notification may be warranted.
- `External Communications`
    - Depending on the incident's nature and impact, external communications may be necessary. This could involve notifying customers, partners, regulatory bodies, or even the general public.

## 5. Detailed Investigation & Reporting

> The duration of this phase can vary significantly, ranging from a couple of days to potentially years. What's crucial here is a comprehensive technical analysis coupled with a compilation of all findings. This in-depth investigation is vital for understanding the incident's full impact.

## 6. Final Report Creation

> The culmination of your role as a security analyst or incident responder is the creation of a finalized incident report. This document will furnish regulators, insurers, and executive leadership with a detailed account of the incident, its origins, and the remedial actions taken.

## 7. Feedback Loop!

> Post-incident reflection is essential for enhancing our preparedness for future incidents. This involves revisiting and analyzing the incident to identify areas for improvement.
