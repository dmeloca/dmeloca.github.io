# Working with files and directories
The importance of knowing how to work with files via CLI, remains on the powerful of the commands that have been developed, which allows us to access and edit the files without leaving the terminal.

The efficiency is improved by:

- Editing files selectively via `regex`.
- Running multiple commands at once.
- Redirecting ouput.
- Automating the batch editing files.

## Create, Move and Copy

- `touch <name>` creates an empty file named as `<name>`
- `mkdir <name>` creates a directory named as `<name>`

> [!TIP]
> The `-p` option of the `mkdir` command create all the directory parents we specify. (i.e `mkdir -p Storage/local/user/documents`)

- `mv <file/directory> <destiny path>` moves the specify file/document into the specified changed path.
 
**Task**: Investigate how to rename files using `mv`.

- `cp <file/directory> <destiny path>` copy the specified file/document into the destiny path

**Task**: 

- Learn about redirectors.
- How to defend using nvim/vim.
- Investigate how to remove a file.
- Learn inode number
