### Preparation, detection & analysis
Where a lot of time is spend improving ourselves and looking for the next malicious event.
When Detected, we move to the next stage, but is important to understand that as new evidence is discovered the next steps may change. Is vital to ensure to not skip steps in the process and that you complete a step before moving onto the next one.
*Incident handling has two main steps **investigating** and **Recovering***
- Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an (ongoing if still active) incident timeline
- Determine what tools and malware the adversary used
- Document the compromises systems and what the adversary has done
The recovery activity involves creating and implementing a recovery plan. When implemented, the business should resume its normal activities

> When an incident is fully handled, a report is issued that details the cause and cost of the incident. Additionally, "lessons learned" activities are performed, among others, to understand what the organization should do to prevent incidents of similar type from occurring again.
