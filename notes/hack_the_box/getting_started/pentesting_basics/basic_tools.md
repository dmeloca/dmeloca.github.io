## Using SSH
Secure Shell (22) provides a secure way to access a computer remotely.
**How it is secured?** by a public-key authentication using an SSH public/private kay pair 
`ssh <user>@<ip_addr>`
> It is also possible to read local private keys on a compromised system or add our public key to gain SSH access to a specific user, as we'll discuss in a later section. As we can see, SSH is an excellent tool for securely connecting to a remote machine. It also provides a way for mapping local ports on the remote machine to our localhost, which can become handy at times.

## Using Netcat
Network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports.
**Usages**:
- Connecting to shells
- connect to any listening port and interact with the service
	- `netcat <ip> 22` for connecting into an ssh
	- Banner Grabbing, identify which service is running on that port
**Alternatives**
- Powercat: for windows
- socat: forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices. Update a shell to a fully interactive TTY.
