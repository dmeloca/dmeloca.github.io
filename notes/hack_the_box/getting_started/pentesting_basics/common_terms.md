|**Shell Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Reverse shell`|Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.|
|`Bind shell`|"Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.|
|`Web shell`|Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands (i.e., leveraging a file upload vulnerability and uploading a `PHP` script to run a single command.|
## What is a Port?
Virtual points where network connections begin and end
HTTP  : 80
