## Using wget
**Steps**
1. Stablish a server where the file is located
	- `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Get the file:
	- `wget <url>`
	- `curl <url> -o <file name>`
## Using SCP
When we have ssh credentials of the remote host we can do: `scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh` saved at `/tmp`
## Using Base64
When we are not able to transfer files, firewall or other protections, we can use base64 encoding to copy the encoded file in our machine and later decoding it

## Validating File Transfers
To validate the format file we can: `file shell` or comparing hashes with `md5sum`
