## Finding Public Exploits
**Tools**
1. `searchsploit`
	- `searchsploit <technology>`
## Metasploit Primer
Contains many built in exploits for many public vulns
**Features**
- Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
- Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
- Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and run commands on the compromised targets
- Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools
**Usage**: 
1. `msfconsole`: enter to the framework
2. `search exploit <vuln>`: searching for vulnerabilities
	- _tip_: Search can apply complex filters such as search `cve:2009 type:exploit.` See all the filters with help search
3. `use <exploit>`: to use the exploit
4. `show options`: see what options the exploit requires to function
5. `set <OPTION>`: to assign a value to the specific option
6. `check`: test if the server is vulnerable
7. `exploit/run`: to run the exploit
