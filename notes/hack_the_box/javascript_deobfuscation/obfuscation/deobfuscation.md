## Beautify
**Tools**
- open browser debugger [`CTRL+SHIFT+Z`], click on pretty print
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/playground/)
- [Beautifier](https://beautifier.io/)
- [d4js](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/)
**Note** This process just will make the code readable (not Deobfuscate it)
## Deobfuscate
**Tools**:
- [UnPacker](https://matthewfl.com/unPacker.html)
- Find the return value and print it instead of executing it.
**Note**: Be careful with the spaces, could help with inaccurate results

## Reverse Engineering
When using personalized obfuscation tools we will need reverse engineering.
