**Code Minification**: having the entire code in a single line (used for large scripts)

- [javascript-minifier](https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier)
*Note:*

## Packing JavaScript code
**Tools:**
- [BeautifyTools](https://beautifytools.com/javascript-obfuscator.php)
**Note:** Packing could be recognizable from the six function arguments used as "`function(p,a,c,k,e,d)`"
**How it works**
- It attempts to convert words and symbols into a list or dictionary and refer them using `(p,a,c,k,e,d)` 
- The function can vary from on packer to another
- It contains a certain order in which the elements were packed to know how to order them during execution.
**Note**: The main strings still written in clear text.
