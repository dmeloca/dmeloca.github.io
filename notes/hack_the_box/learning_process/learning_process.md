## Way of Thinking
- Find what we do not know
- Think about different ways to solve a problem
## Think outside the box
## Occam's razor
> The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.`
### Occam's Razor in Practice
Understand the overall concept rather than the individual steps involved. ***Ex:*** Once we are familiar with SQL injection and how it occurs, we may find the individual steps involved.
> The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.
## Talent
We can develop and train such talent for any field we want.
## Way Of Learning
- Frustration and confusion come with the point of view we are looking at.
- **Know your Goal**
!# TODO: Write a Goal
## Learning Efficiency
- Overcome the combination of past knowledge, adaptation and new information
- What kind of info i need?
	- What do we already know?
	- What do we not know yet?
- Adapt information to our strengths and weaknesses
- We have to fail
!# TODO: Learn about the Learning pyramid
## Learning Types
### Active Learning
- Discussing and practicing the topics
### Information
Information quality depends on the motivation, focus and goal
### Motivation
- Recognizing the smallest success
- Taking breaks and remain calm
- make associations
!# TODO: find the best way for us to think creatively
## The Brain
- Is important to know our brain
- We need to make connections of terms.
## The Will
- Dream with the future of the Goal
- Do not have fear of something we have never done before
- Have on mind a clear goal
## The Goal
- Setting challenging and specific goals
- Focus on the process
- Create chains of associations (derive a task into smaller)
## Decision Making
- make questions to have more context

> Decide (`Decision Making`) on the goal defined in detail (`The Goal`) that you really want to achieve from your heart (`Willingness`), and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously (`The Brain`).

### Question states
Make precise questions, without including irrelevant things.

### Question in General
Aspects:
	1. origin
	2. process
	3. result/goal
Obtain Information
> A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.

## Handling Frustration
>Frustration passes, the experience we have gained through it remains.

## Learning Process
Make small changes
