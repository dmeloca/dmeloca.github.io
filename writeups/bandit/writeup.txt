bandit 0
--> bandit0:bandit0

bandit0 -> bandit1
    In this level there is only one file (where the password is located).
    command: `cat readme`
    flag: ZjLjTmM6FvvyRnrb2rfNWOZOTa6ip5If
bandit1 -> bandit2
    At this level we encounter a file with an special character.
    command: `cat ./-`
    explanation: As we know the `.` means the actual directory, so we are giving
    a relative path to the "dashed" file.
    flag: 263JGJPfgU6LtdEvgfWU1XP5yac29mFx
bandit2 -> bandit 3
    The file we want to explore has special characters and spaces.
    command: `cat ./--spaces\ in\ this\ filename--`
    explanation: In this case we use the trick of the level above and we use \ 
    to escape the spaces.

bandit3 -> bandit4
    This level consists on knowing how to manage hidden files, as general knowledge
    hidden files on linux are saved as `.<name>`.
    command: `cat ./...Hiding-From-You`
    explanation: we can find the file by doing `ls -la` which list all files, including
    hidden ones.
    flag: 2WmrDFRmJIq3IPxneAaMGhap0pFhF3NJ
bandit4 -> bandit5
    We need to filter by the file type, in order to search for a human readable
    file in a folder.
    command: `file ./-*`
    explanation: with file we get the type of each file in the folder, using 
    tricks of levels above and if you want to go beyond you can use grep to search
    for the word `text`.
